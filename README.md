This is just a dumb personal project that's meant to simulate the basics of a command-line OS, and maybe also be a game eventually.
Don't mind me, I just didn't want to by the premium version or whatever of GitHub. 
If you want to contribute, ask yourself if you really, really do, 
and then you can email me at ryan.callister@gmail.com. 
Thank ya muchly.
